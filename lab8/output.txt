What suggestions do you have for improving how the instructor taught the course?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. One thing would be to maybe ask for more class participation in lecture
       aspects to keep students motivated/interested.
    2. Please, do NOT use idle for demonstrating code. It is very difficult to
       follow the changes and correct mistakes. Please use Pycharm or even
       notepad.Â Starting programs could be a bit more challenging. Now we are
       at a good level of difficulty for how far we are in the course. It would
       have been helpful when using args to explain the parameters more.
       Telling us to go read the documentation isn't teaching. Class time feels
       like too much talking and showing and not as much teaching Â
    3. Im not sure. Something about how he explains it makes it so that it
       doesn't stick with me. dont put stuff on tests and quizes that havn't
       been on a submitted program. (IE: input/exceptions) Doing something
       first time on a test or quiz is incredibly stressful.
    4. This probably doesnâ€™t apply to everyone but I do have a somewhat
       difficult time following along with the programming done in class. I try
       writing down as much of the programs as I can to reference back to but I
       never manage to get it all. It would be nice to get a copy/ text file of
       the programs written in class to reference back to. I know in some cases
       there are similar programs on canvas but this has not always been the
       case and it would be easier for me to look at what was specifically
       covered in class.
    5. Explain in more detail what certain parts of python accomplish and how
       they work. A large majority of the class is showing code that we have
       not learned yet. A lot of our learning is reading the book or course
       information on our own, which is fine, but going over these concepts
       after we have read them would be very beneficial.
    6. The instructor could go more into detail on the details (like figuring
       out how to compress code down onto a single line using the special
       python approaches)
    7. maybe quizzes can help?Â he did good enough already
    8. Hope the teacher teaches the lectures slowly, and explains the lecture's
       content more clearly For example, give a few examples so that students
       can understand how that function or program operates and understand the
       program's logic.
    9. I think teaching through a python file as supposed to the terminal would
       be easier to understand.
   10. It would be nice if he could follow a more structured format for his
       presentations, it can be very hard to follow along sometimes.
   11. More detailed personal feedback on assignments would be nice, but that
       takes a lot of time, so not including it is understandable.
   12. He seems a little bit nervous while teaching the class. Maybe be a
       little bit more confident
   13. I personally enjoy jumping around through various topics of python, but
       there's an uncertainty to me about what will be on quizzes and tests. I
       now realize that we are only tested over what we write programs for, at
       least that's how it seems, but many people in my class still aren't
       quite aware of that and I wasn't at the beginning. If we, for example,
       look at a database python module, is it just for our benefit that we're
       learning it, or is it going to be pertinent to passing the course?
       Detailing what is necessary to do well in the course and what is just
       for our benefit as programmers would be helpful. After all, this is an
       elective course. Most people who take this don't just care about a nice
       letter grade.
   14. Speak slower. Try to keep student engage. Don't rush through the
       material.
   15. Slow down, Rather advanced topics are being thrown at us at a very fast
       rate and this is only a elective class.
   16. More enthusiastic delivery of the course material would help when trying
       to follow along in class.
   17. I dont have ideas at this time
   18. Have greater clarity on the different method types and how they operate
===============================================================================

What did you like best about how the instructor taught the course?
------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. An abundance of material available on Canvas.
    2. I like how he gave us many useful websites/resources to complete our
       programs and further our learning.
    3. He covered multiple methods to solve the problems.
    4. Mr. Chappell was very helpful to students when a question was asked. He
       would provide the question and answers for all students on canvas. And
       he was very understanding when there was a problem or delay when turning
       in assignments.
    5. He replies emails very detail and give me good examples
    6. Help student when we ask for help
    7. I liked how chill and passionate the instructor was with the course
    8. He is willing to help a lot with problems to guide us.
    9. I hope the teacher do not give us very hard functions, or program
       assignment. If give us a very hard program assignment, please give us
       some clues or idea to direct us. because python has many functions and
       syntax that we do not very familiar with.
   10. He brings a great deal of enthusiasm for the language that is
       contagious.
   11. He will work through programs similar to our homework assignments so we
       can learn alternative and more efficient means to work our programs
   12. How well the canvas is organized. I have never had a teacher put as much
       effort into making a good canvas experience for their students and I
       really enjoy that.
   13. I like how if you are stuck on something he doesn't just leave you
       hanging.
   14. I like how he shows many different ways of solving a problem and allows
       us to choose one. He shows us a good solution to the programs when we
       have completed them. He is well educated in python Â Â
   15. I like how what is discussed in class is also followable on canvas
       itself, and so it is easy to find examples that were gone over in class
       that I was not able to write down.
   16. He is always willing to help with assignments.
   17. Mr. Chappelle is very humble, and that makes him instantly likeable. As
       a northerner and someone with moderate ADHD, I find his talking speed a
       comfortable pace for the class and I feel like I'm learning a lot more
       in less time because of it. I also like his willingness to provide
       answers and communicate with his students.
   18. nothing really stands out
===============================================================================

What did you like best about the course?
----------------------------------------
    1. The language is very fun. We get to explore many modules. He allows many
       ways to solve our programs. The programs are educational and easy.Â
    2. I am undecided.
    3. learning the basics of the language
    4. The best that I like about this course is that every time when I go to
       the teacher's office to ask the teacher some questions, the teacher is
       very patient to teach me, and helps me to solve the questions properly.
    5. learnt and played with pycharm to work with files
    6. I definitely feel a little bit more stretched in this course, which I
       feel is helping me understand python on a deeper level.
    7. I like that it is over python. Python is a super cool language.Â
    8. I have enjoyed learning python.
    9. The maturity of it. The way the information and assignments are
       presented make me feel like the instructor/course respects my abilities.
       It's more open-ended and fun, but gives me room to think/search for
       things and learn on my own. I honestly love that and it's refreshing
       from other courses at this school.
   10. That I feel like I'm actually learning something new.
   11. The language
   12. Improving my knowledge of python
   13. I think it has a mostly good pace of things so far
   14. Learning a new, popular language
   15. Python. I really enjoy the language.
   16. The assignments, although too easy for the most part in my opinion, were
       fun to do.
   17. It has given me a base to be able to use this language in the future.Â
   18. Python code is much simpler than other languages in that there is a lot
       of built in types, functions, and loops.
===============================================================================

What suggestions do you have for improving the course?
------------------------------------------------------
    1. I think the course could use a little more focus. Sometimes it feels
       like we talk about a subject and then leave the subject, but then we
       come back to it and it is a little confusing. By this, I don't mean that
       we come back to a subject after we learn more that will help us do more,
       because doing this makes sense. Instead I feel like we go back and forth
       sometimes without a ton of reason. (one example being not doing all file
       work stuff in a single given time, because we started working on
       argparse but then we came back to files and it seemed really odd).
    2. More clarity with quiz/test material is the primary thing. I know most
       of the people in the class, and some of them are having trouble not
       because they are bad programmers, but because of the scope of the
       material was broader than they expected. Written material and the
       instructor need to be more clear on what will be on tests and quizzes
       for study purposes. Â
    3. Assignments with more challenges to them would be nice.
    4. better detail in the explanation of some finer and complex terms.
    5. Explain concepts without code first, then apply the code to the concepts
       that were taught.
    6. I think having a quiz more often would be nice, so you don't have only 3
       quiz grades by the end of the semester
    7. Quicker feedback on assignments would be helpful, especially when a test
       is coming up.
    8. Don't try to get into as many advanced topics as possible, this is the
       first time that many have ever seen or heard of this language.
    9. Show more examples in the program format.
   10. Do not use IDLE past the first class period. That is not a real-world
       scenario. Explain more of what = '__main__' does and its purpose vs just
       making the whole file main During the first class, go over the style
       guides main requirements. while learning obscure ways to do certain
       actions is fun, we should also focus on the most common ways. program 6
       example output should be more accurate. Allowing us to be within 5% of
       the correct answer doesn't teach us the correct way to achieve the
       correct outcome. Example: use regex to remove all punctuation instead of
       just a select few.
   11. I hope that teacher teaches the python's content more clearly and
       specifically. especially for some hard parts of python. Let students can
       really understand python, program logic, and type the code more
       efficiently than before.
   12. overall its pretty good and we learnt lot of useful commands in python.
       one thing I would suggest is that we could have some written test or
       quiz, that might helps in students learning python as well. also if we
       could have pycharm installed in lab computer would also help
   13. Include more clarity on the functionality of different aspects of the
       python language Change the due dates for projects so we can have the
       weekend to work on the projects instead of only Monday - Friday
   14. Nothing that I can think of at the momentÂ
   15. Teach slower Communicate efficiently Â
   16. Some kind of access to lecture notes that the teacher types up in class
       would be very beneficial to at least me personally.
   17. more class time to work on the programs. college is busy and other
       classes have a ton of homework too. Â
   18. None yet.
